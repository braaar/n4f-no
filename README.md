# Hyperion â€“ Norsk Forbund For Fantastiske Fritidsinteresser

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:  
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Style Guide

This project uses [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) and [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/). We have also inherited the same file structure as _CrowdRiff_ uses, whom are focused around feature. This is a fairly common method in React development, that really support scaling our project.


```
n4f-frontend/
	src/
		components/
			feature/
				__tests__/
				components/
					FeatureList.jsx
					FeatureList.scss
				Container.jsx
				Container.scss
				
```

The example above shows our typical flow.
